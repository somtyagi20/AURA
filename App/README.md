**Smart Home Automation System**
==========================

**Overview**
------------

This project is an AI-driven Smart Home Automation System with IoT integration, designed to enhance security, energy efficiency, and appliance control. The system is controlled via a React Native mobile app and features real-time intruder detection, fire/smoke alarms, smart locks, energy consumption tracking, and dynamic device management.

**Features**
------------

* **Real-time Intruder Detection**: AI-powered computer vision detects and alerts users to potential security threats.
* **Fire/Smoke Alarms**: Integrated sensors detect fire and smoke, triggering alerts and notifications.
* **Smart Locks**: Secure and control access to your home with smart locks integrated with the system.
* **Energy Consumption Tracking**: Monitor and optimize energy usage in real-time.
* **Dynamic Device Management**: Easily add, remove, and control devices connected to the system.

**Technical Details**
--------------------

* **Frontend**: React Native mobile app for user interaction and control.
* **Backend**: Cloud-based services (AWS/Azure/Google Cloud) for data processing, AI model deployment, and device management.
* **State Management**: Redux for efficient state management and data synchronization.
* **AI Models**: Trained models for computer vision, object detection, and predictive analytics.
* **IoT Integration**: Compatible with various IoT devices and protocols (e.g., Zigbee, Z-Wave, Bluetooth).
